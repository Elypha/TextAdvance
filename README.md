# TextAdvance [beta]
Automatically skips subtitle boxes and confirms cutscene skipping.

**TextAdvance automatically disables itself every time you log out and requires you to type `/at` command whenever you want to reenable it.**

This tool was mainly written to assist levelling alts. It will auto-skip skippable quest text and skip skippable cutscenes automatically. **Unskippable cutscenes will not be skipped**, but text inside them will be clicked.

If several cutscenes play back to back you will have to press esc for 2nd and further cutscenes yourself. I was too lazy to implement autoskipping for that case since it happens not very often.
