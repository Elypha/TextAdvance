# TextAdvance
# [⚠ For installation instructions please click here. ⚠](https://github.com/Eternita-S/MyDalamudPlugins#installation)
A tool to assist with questing. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eternita-S/MyDalamudPlugins/main/TextAdvance/icon.png"></p>

**Note: only works with english, deutch and chinese clients currently. If you want support for other language, please proceed into Issues and provide me some information, and I will add the support.**

Current functions:
- Automatically skip quest subtitles
- Automatically skip cutscenes (if several cutscenes are played sequentially, only first will be skipped automatically)
- Automatically confirm cutscene skipping
- Automatically accept quest 
- Automatically confirm quest completion
- Configurable buttons to temporarily pause or enable plugin.

**TextAdvance automatically disables itself every time you log out and requires you to type `/at` command whenever you want to reenable it.**

Alternatively, you can configure characters on which you want it to automatically enable upon log in.

If several cutscenes play back to back you will have to press esc for 2nd and further cutscenes yourself. I was too lazy to implement autoskipping for that case since it happens not very often.
