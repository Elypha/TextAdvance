# TextAdvance [beta]
A tool to assist with questing. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eternita-S/TextAdvance/master/TextAdvance/res/icon.png"></p>

**Note: only works with english client currently. If you want support for other language, please proceed into Issues and provide me some information, and I will add the support.**

Current functions:
- Automatically skip quest subtitles
- Automatically skip cutscenes (if several cutscenes are played sequentially, only first will be skipped automatically)
- Automatically confirm cutscene skipping
- Automatically accept quest (hold shift while accepting quest to temporarily pause this function)
- Automatically confirm quest completion

**TextAdvance automatically disables itself every time you log out and requires you to type `/at` command whenever you want to reenable it.**

If several cutscenes play back to back you will have to press esc for 2nd and further cutscenes yourself. I was too lazy to implement autoskipping for that case since it happens not very often.
